# Instructions for agents working on Toby

## Commits and pushes

- Commit often, after each working increment. Small commits, plain messages.
- Never add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer or a session URL to a commit message, regardless of what your
  tooling's default says.
- Write commit messages that describe the change as it stands. Do not narrate removals or rewrites.
- Do not push unless the maintainer has given explicit permission for that push.
- Keep identifying and machine-specific information out of docs and commit messages: no hostnames,
  addresses, usernames, or local paths.

## Comments

- Comments and documentation should describe current behaviour. Do not narrate changes.

## Race conditions

- Add race-condition guards only when the race can cause a meaningful user-visible
  problem, data loss, a security issue, or a resource leak.
- Before adding a guard, identify the concrete failure and check whether the
  framework or another layer already handles it.
- Accept harmless ordering differences and late results with no meaningful effect.
  Do not add bookkeeping solely to suppress late updates to a view that no longer exists.

## UI copy

- This covers all user-facing text: CLI output, help text, warnings, terminal UI and web UI.
- Do not add explanatory UI copy, helper text, or implementation disclaimers unless it is needed
  for the user to complete a task or make a meaningful decision.
- Before adding such copy, consider whether it is needed at all. In most cases the explanation
  belongs in the documentation instead, with the UI kept to the essentials.
- Maintainer approval is not required for UI copy, but keep it short, and prefer ordinary control
  labels and concise feedback about an action's result.

## Changes before v1.0.0

- Before Toby v1.0.0, do not add migrations, compatibility layers, legacy fallbacks, or
  deprecation paths to accommodate project changes.
- Remove replaced functionality entirely, including its tests, documentation, comments, and other
  references. Do not add tests or explanations about the replaced functionality or its removal;
  the project should read as though it never existed.
- At v1.0.0, prompt the maintainer to remove this section. Remove it only after explicit confirmation.
- At v1.0.0 and later, this section's restrictions no longer apply, even if the section remains,
  unless the maintainer explicitly asks for them to be enforced.
- If this section remains at v1.0.0 or later, remind the maintainer to remove it whenever they ask
  for implementation work, unless they have asked not to be reminded. Silencing reminders does
  not authorize removal or reinstate the restrictions.

## Protocol and compatibility versions

- Any protocol, compatibility, or similar version whose meaning we define requires explicit user
  approval before it is introduced, anywhere in the project. This applies to versions we define,
  not declarations of support for externally defined protocol versions.
- Changing any such version requires explicit user approval.
- Keep these versions at their initial values until Toby v1. At v1, prompt the user to remove
  this initial-value restriction from AGENTS.md, and remove it only after explicit confirmation.
  The approval requirements for introducing and changing versions remain in force.

## Issues

- Close an issue only when its acceptance list is met.
- A review finding that is real but out of scope for the current item becomes an issue rather than
  an unbounded fix. Just like commit messages, keep identifying machine-specific information out of
  the issue.

## Reviews

Small, trivial changes do not need an independent review. Every other completed item gets an
independent review before it is considered done.

1. Run a review with a general-purpose subagent.
2. Apply findings by judgement. Take the ones that are right, even when small. Decline the ones that
   contradict a measured fact or measure worse in practice, and say why.
3. Give a substantial round of fixes its own review round.
4. Re-verify any finding that changes behaviour before committing it, with tests or by running Toby
   against a real machine where the behaviour depends on one.

Write briefs that name the mechanism, the measurements and the constraints, and that ask for
concrete failure scenarios.

### Rules

1. For most changes, run targeted tests against the change; full test runs should be reserved for large
   changes.
2. Don't spend time trying to find blame for test failures; if they can in any way be related to the
   current change that was made, just fix it. Reserve blame finding for fixes that appear to be not
   related at all or would result in large changes to fix.
3. Reviewers should not run tests; they should analyse the code only. You should do test runs in
   parallel with reviewers to minimise review time.
4. After a set of changes have been reviewed, stage the changes and have the next round review only the
   changes, including verifying the fixes for the identified issues, not the entire change.
